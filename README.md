# Calendar

This application was my final project for CS410: Voice Assistants at Portland State University. It is a voice assistant that schedules and manages calendar events. I created this application through [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow), a natural language understanding platform from Google.

# Features

* Add a calendar event
* Locate a calendar event
* Update a calendar event
* Duplicate a calendar event
* Undo/complete a calendar event
* Sort calendar events

# How to use

## Create calendar event
Enter the type of event (reminder, event, etc), the day/time, and the location. If you just enter one of these, the voice assistant will prompt for more info. You will also need to enter a valid command to trigger the add intent: "add", "create", "schedule", "make", etc.

Sample commands: _create a birthday party on June 1st 5:00PM in Los Angeles_
                 _make a calendar event for tomorrow in Seattle_
